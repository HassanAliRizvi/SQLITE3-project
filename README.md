# SQLITE3 PROJECT THAT STORES EMPLOYEE INFORMATION

Welcome to my SQLITE3 project that stores employee information. Users can either manually type in the information or use the voice bot to either insert or delete the employee or get employees from the data. 

# VOICE COMMANDS

## Modules to import for the voice bot
	import speech_recognition as sr  
	from gtts import gTTS  
	import playsound  
	import random  

## The speak_text() function makes the voice bot talk using the playsound and gTTS module while the get_audio() function takes in input
from the user to i

# Modules for the database
	from employee import Employees  
	import sqlite3 
	import os  
	import re
